# Crimes-in-NYC

Welcome to this Exploratory Analysis of the first months of 2019 “New York City Crimes” dataset. I really enjoyed diving into this dataset, and here’s why I think you will too:

It includes diverse datatypes - this analysis includes datetimes, and latitude/longitude point data

It’s from the government - meaning it’s credible (and likely to give us some practice with data cleaning!)

The models we build can be easily expanded to include data from earlier years
