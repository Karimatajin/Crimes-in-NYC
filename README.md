# Crimes-in-NYC

Welcome to this Exploratory Analysis during the first months of 2019 “New York City Crimes” dataset. I really enjoyed diving into this dataset, and here’s why I think you will too:

It includes diverse datatypes - this analysis includes datetimes, and latitude/longitude point data

It’s from the government - meaning it’s credible (and likely to give us some practice with data cleaning!)

This kernel is intended to identify and visualize interesting tidbits within this dataset, as well as provide some tools for those who want to learn how to use R to perform their own exploratory analyses.
